# 1. Write a program to generate the desired output for the model of Section 7.2.
# Use it to estimate the average time that a customer spends in the system and
# the average amount of overtime put in by the server, in the case where the
# arrival process is a Poisson process with rate 10, the service time density is
# g(x) = 20eâˆ’40x (40x)2 , x > 0
# and T = 9. First try 100 runs and then 1000.


# 2. Suppose in the model of Section 7.2 that we also wanted to obtain information
# about the amount of idle time a server would experience in a day. Explain how
# this could be accomplished.
