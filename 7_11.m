# 11. Suppose that claims are made to an insurance company according to a Poisson
# process with rate 10 per day. The amount of a claim is a random variable that has
# an exponential distribution with mean $1000. The insurance company receives
# payments continuously in time at a constant rate of $11,000 per day. Starting
# with an initial capital of $25,000, use simulation to estimate the probability
# that the firmâ€™s capital is always positive throughout its first 365 days.
